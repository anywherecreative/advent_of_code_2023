# Advent Of Code 2023 In rust

Possibly the worst possible way to organize and present the 24 days of advent of code 
using the rust programming language. Each day is seperated into it's own function in the main.rs
file. Refactoring is probably warranted, but given the nature of the challange was not a priority. 

feel free to reuse, or distribute.
